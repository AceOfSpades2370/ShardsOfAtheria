Shards of Atheria is a mod that adds many new items, weapons, accessories and random stuff I feel like adding. Soon the mod will emphasize more on making coherent lore. (unlike Terraria "lore", which will also be rewritten)

MASSIVE thank you to the TML team and others in the server for the huge help otherwise I would have never gotten this far in making the mod
As well as the creator of the Parrying Daggers mod for letting me use their reflecting code, link to the mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2765225124
